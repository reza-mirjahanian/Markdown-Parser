# My Document

This is a paragraph that should remain.

## Section with Code

Here is some explanation about the code:
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
And here is more text after the code block.

## Section with Table

Some text before the table:

| Name   | Age | City    |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Alice  | 30  | Tehran  |
| Bob    | 25  | Isfahan |

Text after the table should remain.

## Another Code Block

~~~python
def hello():
print("Hello!")
~~~

## Mixed Section

This paragraph is between a table and code:

| Feature  | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Parsing  | Done   |
| Render   | WIP    |

javascript
console.log("test");

Final paragraph that should remain.
